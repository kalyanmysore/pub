# Work history
## Encompass systems
Requirements analyst, software developer and tester of a custom sales management system for a company that sold and supported software. I initially authored the first few iterations using Microsoft Visual Foxpro as requested by the client. However, due to performance limitations of Visual Foxpro, I rewrote and continued further iterations with Delphi for better performance. I learnt Delphi and was productive in a couple of weeks. The project used Delphi (which used object oriented Pascal) and SQL (using InterBase). 

## PSI data systems
Tech lead of team that developed Point of Sale cash register system software for Hectronic GmbH. I also wrote interfacing code for credit card terminals and fuel station pumps. Visited customer sites in Bonndorf, Germany for deeper understanding and integration. We used Delphi (object oriented pascal) and Sybase RDBMS with SQL.

## Wipro Infotech
Joined their newly created ecommerce division. Developed an intranet web based leave management system for the department. Used Microsoft ASP, COM and SQL server.

## HP India
Worked on development of their ChangeEngine workflow/process management system. Visited HP Japan for requirements and technical discussions.

## John Deere
### Application information management system
John Deere had (and has) a vast dealer network. The dealers were installing updates via CDROMs received via mail. We wrote a software to deliver software updates faster over an occasionally connected, modem based low bandwidth internet. We used Microsoft VC++, COM and network programming. I was in charge of the network connectivity and file transfer part of the project. In today's world, some background update components are included with most software, as part of the installer (such as installshield)

### JDLink 
I was part of John Deere's foray into telematics since the early days. I started as a lead of the web team (using Microsoft ASP and SQL server). However, my background in embedded computing and hardware led to the client requesting me to lead the On-machine software. Once I stabilized that part of the project, I was asked to lead the next weakest link, which was the communication server and data center software (before the term "cloud" became prevalent). 
In our first versions, we collected basic information on hours of operation, exception conditions and implemented geofences. Over time, I was a big part of evolving the data collection to be highly configurable, with optional onboard data aggregation. Over the years, I've worked with realtime operating systems such as RTXC, VxWorks, Windows CE. Our new versions are able to use linux with realtime extensions with the onboard hardware having evolved to have sufficient compute and memory. For communications, we evolved from analog data thru UDP thru TCP/IP to eventually using IoT (using MQTT). During our initial days, I've been part of interface definition with Qualcomm using their telematics device. After some iterations, we evolved to have our own cellular modems on our machines. As systems architect, I was very involved with all data interface definitions between machine and cloud, and flows in the cloud.
